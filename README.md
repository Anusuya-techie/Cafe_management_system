I have done a project on CAFE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM for Cafe Purple. It's a impressive web application built using HTML, CSS for front end and Java for backend. and used MySQL for database. 
Using my web application customer can order from cafe an they can see the offer details, special dishes.
Admin can view the orders placed by customers and they can add or edit food items and quantity of the foods.
I used MySQL for database to store the details of the customers and orders.
